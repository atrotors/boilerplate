# boilerplate
A boilerplate created powered by grunt with Bootstrap and Fontawesome included.
This boilerplate has Bootstrap and Fontawesome in their uncompiled, less version. This makes it easier for changes to the library especially in Bootstrap which has an extensive use of variable that makes it extra easy to customize this library.
