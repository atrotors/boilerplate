# boilerplate
A boilerplate powered by grunt with Bootstrap and Fontawesome included.

This boilerplate has Bootstrap and Fontawesome in their uncompiled, less version. This makes it easier for changes to the libraries.

## Installation

Clone the git repo - `git clone https://github.com/atrotors/boilerplate.git` and then rename the directory to the name of your website.

This boilerplate uses [Grunt](gruntjs.com) and [Bower](bower.io). To run Grunt and Bower you need to install [node.js](nodejs.org) and [npm](www.npmjs.com) from their websites.

1. First you need to install Grunt and Bower with `npm install -g grunt bower`.
2. Go to the website directory and run `npm install`.
3. Run `bower install`.

Now you can run `grunt dev` to compile the website uminified with souce map, or you could run `grunt build` to get the website minified and production ready.
